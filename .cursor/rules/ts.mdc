## Code Style and Structure
- Use strict types instead of any.
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types. Avoid enums, use maps.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.

## Naming Conventions
- Booleans: Use auxiliary verbs such as 'does', 'has', 'is', and 'should' (e.g., isDisabled, hasError).
- Filenames: Use lowercase with dash separators (e.g., auth-wizard.tsx).

- File extensions: Use .config.ts, .test.ts, .context.tsx, .type.ts as appropriate.
