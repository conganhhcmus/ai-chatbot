# Sprint 2 Review

**Goal:** Verify the chatbot can dynamically call APIs and generate rich, multi-lingual responses.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] **Dynamic Reporting & Language:**
    - [ ] When a user asks for a report in Vietnamese, the planner calls the correct skill and the final response (including any data tables) is in Vietnamese.
    - [ ] The planner's output is a valid rich JSON object (e.g., a table or text with actions).
- [ ] **Cancellation:**
    - [ ] A "Cancel" button appears while a report is generating.
    - [ ] Clicking the button successfully stops the backend query.
- [ ] **Integration:** All Phase 1 functionality remains stable.
