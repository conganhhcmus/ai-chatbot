# Sprint 2 Review

    - [x] The planner's output is a valid rich JSON object (e.g., a table or text with actions).
- [x] **Cancellation:**
    - [x] A "Cancel" button appears while a report is generating.
    - [x] Clicking the button successfully stops the backend query.
- [x] **Integration:** All Phase 1 functionality remains stable.
