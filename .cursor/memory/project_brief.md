# Project Brief: Intelligent AI Chatbot

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to build an intelligent and interactive AI chatbot system. The chatbot will serve as a powerful reporting assistant, capable of understanding natural language queries, fetching data from internal systems, and presenting it in a rich, interactive format.

## 2. Core User-Facing Features
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** A floating chat bubble that opens into a user-friendly chat window.
- **Rich Message Responses:** The chatbot can respond with formatted text (Markdown), tables, and clickable action buttons.
- **Natural Language Reporting:** Users can ask for complex data reports in plain language (e.g., "show me the top 10 billings for last month").
- **Long-Running Query Cancellation:** Users can cancel data queries that are taking too long to execute.
- **Export to Excel:** Users can download the data from reports as an `.xlsx` file.
- **Multi-language Support:** The chatbot can interact with users in their preferred language.
- **Admin-Configurable Actions:** The initial "quick action" buttons are configurable by an administrator.
